# Frontend Project

This is the frontend project for our application, built using React and Next.js. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using a command-line interface.

### Installation

Install the required dependencies by running the following command: npm install

### Development Server

Start the development server by running the following command: npm run dev

This will launch the frontend application on a local development server. You can access it by opening your web browser and visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Connected Pages

This was a hackathon project, so it's not fully connected to the backend yet for all routes. Currently the map, modals and profile pages are connected. However, the 'add record' option is still connected to mock data. 

Feel free to explore and modify the frontend project according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out!

Happy coding!
